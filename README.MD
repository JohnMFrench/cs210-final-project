- Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

This project serves as a client for the Grocery Corner application. It reads a text file that contains a list of items sold that day and outputs a list of their frequencies. 

- What did you do particularly well?

I looked at previous projects to see how I had handled certain requirements like using the Input/Output filestreams. I also compiled frequently as I worked and made sure I was making incremental progress.

- Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

I could add more error handling and documentation.

- Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

Thinking of abstractions for the data was challenging. I probably should have made a custom type for the tuple that stores item name and frequency.

- What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

Understanding pointers, OOP principles, and c++ standard.

- How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I tried to document my code as best as possible and note where something might be confusing.
